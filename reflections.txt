You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

1) This is a good refresh.

2) yes, adding images to the web page and the whole html structure is logical and easy to pickup.

3) nothing.

4) first, I did things I can do directly to the whole document, then I don't know some tags like "sup".
So, I search with google "html super text" and I found the answer in some pages.
